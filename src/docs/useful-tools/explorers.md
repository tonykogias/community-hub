## Etherscan

We have Etherscan explorers for the [Optimism mainnet](https://optimistic.etherscan.io) and the [Optimism Kovan testnet](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io).
Etherscan has lots of tools to help you debug transactions.

Optimistic Etherscan has all the tools you expect from Etherscan, such as:
- [Detailed transaction information](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x292423266d6da24126dc4e0e81890c22a67295cc8b1a987e71ad84748511452f)
- [List of events emitted by a transaction](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x292423266d6da24126dc4e0e81890c22a67295cc8b1a987e71ad84748511452f#eventlog)
- [Contract source code and verification](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F#code)
- And everything else you might find on Etherscan!

It's also got some Optimism-specific features:
- [A list of L1-to-L2 transactions](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/txsEnqueued)
- [A list of L2-to-L1 transactions](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/txsExit)
- [A tool for finalizing L2-to-L1 transactions](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/messagerelayer)
- And more! Just check it out and click around to find all of the available features.

Etherscan currently provides the most advanced block explorers for all Optimism Ethereum networks.



## Access to pre-regenesis history

Because of our final regenesis on 11 November 2021, older transactions are not part of the current blockchain. 
As such, they do not appear, for example, on [Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/).
However, you **can** access transaction history between 23 June 2021 and the final regenesis using the Etherscan CSV exporting tool.

### Etherscan access

[Browse here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/exportDataMain) and select your address and the type of report you want.

### Dune access

If none of the Etherscan CSV files contains the information you need, you can use a query on [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz), similar to [this query](https://dune.xyz/queries/354886?addr=%5Cx25E1c58040f27ECF20BBd4ca83a09290326896B3).
You have to log on with a Dune account, but their free tier is sufficient.

```sql
SELECT * FROM optimism.transactions
WHERE "from"='{{addr}}' or "to"='{{addr}}'
LIMIT 100
```

Notes:
- Make sure to select the data source **Optimism (OVM 1.0)**
- This is how you specify parameters in Dune, `{{` followed by the parameter name and then `}}`. 
- Addresses are specified as `\x<hex address>` rather than `0x<hex address>`.  
- The limit is not required, but here to save resources


### Pre 23 June 2021 history

Please contact us if you need earlier transaction history (prior to 23 June 2021).
